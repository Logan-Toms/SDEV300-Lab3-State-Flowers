# SDEV300-Lab3-State-Flowers

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script developed as part of my college coursework. The project demonstrates my proficiency in Python and my ability to design, manage, and display information. states. This coursework is part of my Building Secure Python Applications (SDEV 300) class at the University of Maryland Global Campus.

## Project Purpose
The main objectives of this project are:
- To display information about each U.S. state including the capital, population, and state flower.
- To allow users to search for specific states and display detailed information.
- To generate and display a bar graph of the top 5 most populated states.
- To update the population data for a specific state.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
Throughout this project, I have gained and demonstrated skills in the following areas:
- **Data Handling**: Managing and manipulating data stored in dictionaries.
- **User Interaction**: Creating a user-friendly command-line interface to interact with the user.
- **Visualization**: Using Matplotlib to create and display visualizations.
- **Input Validation**: Ensuring user inputs are valid and handling errors appropriately.
- **Python Programming**: Writing modular and readable Python code with functions and control flow mechanisms.

## Project Impact
This project has helped me:
- **Enhance Practical Skills**: Applied theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, improving my understanding of Python programming.
- **Improve Data Visualization Skills**: Strengthened my ability to create and interpret visual data representations using Matplotlib.
- **Develop User Interfaces**: Learned to design and implement effective command-line interfaces for user interaction.

## Files Included
- `sdev_wk3_lab3.py`: The main Python script that includes functions for displaying states, searching for specific states, displaying a bar graph of top 5 populated states, and updating state population data.

## Usage Instructions
To run the script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Logan-Toms/SDEV300-Lab3-State-Flowers.git
    cd SDEV300-Lab3-State-Flowers
    ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
    Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib
    ```

3. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python sdev_wk3_lab3.py
    ```

4. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions**:
    - Choose the desired option from the menu to perform different tasks such as displaying states, searching for a state, displaying a population graph, or updating population data.
    - Enter the required inputs as prompted by the script.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used to develop the application.
- **Matplotlib**: A library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
